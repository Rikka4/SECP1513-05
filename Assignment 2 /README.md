## ðŸ¤™REFLECTION
Reflecting on what just mentioned, throughout the visit on UTMDigital have exposed me to lots of new knowledge that could not be learn only by reading in website or book about facility provided by them such as UTM Smart and UTMWifi deeply. We explored various area such as Open Office, Digital Care and TM Room. The facility that is available there far exceed my expectation. What struck me the most is when we visited UTM Data Center that is off limits to the public. I would never have imagined that there exist this kind of place in UTM. From this visit, I have also be able to get to know some of the staff that is working for UTMDigital. This visit has encouraged me to strive harder in my software engineering studies so that I can contribute something amazing just like in the data center toward society.
