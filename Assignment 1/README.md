## OVERVIEW OF ICT JOBS IN CLARITY TECHWORKS SDN BHD
Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For this assignment, we are required to do a poster about the industrial talk that is held via webex which is collaboration of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia and Clarity Techworks Sdn Bhd

## REFLECTION
This industrial talk have given me a lot of exposure regarding position and job scope that is available on computer science field. The talk starts with the speakers give an overview about their company by introducing their main product that is known as Rapidz Pay.

After that, each of the speaker talks about their position and job scope in the company. This discussion revealed about what software used by each of them as well as mention about skills that is essential in this industry. The speakers also inform that what is the difference between study and work life which I find very surprising.

This experiences taught me that I need to build strong foundation on my basic and always be curious about something so that I donâ€™t lose motivation in learning something new. Furthermore, I get lots of valuable information that I do not think I can access this easily.

Frankly, this industrial talk have changed my perspective on work that is related to this field. It seems that I cannot just rely on the class but also explore more about the computer science world by myself as there are many learning materials on the internet such as Udemy. By doing so, I will be able to stay up to date on what the industrial needs nowadays.

In summary, the talk has influenced me to strive harder in my studies so that I can keep up with my fellow peers. Moving forward I plan to acquired qualified certificates as many as I can and be active in the Faculty of Computing to get some new insights.
