# INDUSTRY TALK 2:
## SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT @ CREDENCE (TM SUBSIDIATRY)
Hello There!
For this Assignment 3, we are required to write a report about Industrial Talk 2 that is held via webex which is about System Development @ Credence (TM Subsidiary) on 28th December 2023 from 2.30 to 4.30pm.

## REFLECTION 
Given the current industry trends that were mentioned in the industry talk, I find myself wondering about how I will become a system developer in the next 4 years. It has made me reconsider my strategy to excel in system development. My initial thought is that, it is important to adapt to new software as the realm of computer science is ever-changing. Perhaps I can achieve this by self-learning as there are many resources on the internet like Udemy. Later, I am thinking of solving as many programming problems as much as I can to develop critical thinking skills as this is the most crucial step to becoming a system developer. Afterward, I planned on improving and developing interpersonal skills such as communication as the jobs required to work in a team.
