## REFLECTION
A significant realization has awoken within myself while attending this talk which are rapid development of technologies have really made our daily task easy. For instance, the existence of I-FARM as from the talk can greatly improve our life productivity as it is time saver. What I mean by this is that we can just order the desired vegetables via e-commerce marketplace together with delivery service as well as maintaining the vegetables freshness. Other than that, this technologies also reduce the food waste as we can only order for a day amount. This talk have really inspired me to work harder on my computer science study so I can develop other technologies that can help to improve daily life activities.
