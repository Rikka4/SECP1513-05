# PC Assemble
Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

For this part we are learning on how to disassemble and assemble a PC step by step guided by technician.
## REFLECTION
The lab session really sparking my interest in PC Assemble as this is my first time assembling a PC. As I have never assembling a PC, I thought that it would be quite hard but the technician who guided us did an excellent job patiently explaining every component that we need to know.

During the assembling, I have got to see and touch the computer hardware. The assembling process is quite troublesome as there is a lot of screw and we would be in trouble even if we lose one of it. Furthermore the technician also inform us that we should handle the RAM with care as we would damage it if we hold it wrongly. For me, the hardest part during assembling is assemble the power supply due to small space.

After the assembling I have face a small problem which the PC would not turn on. Hence we have to disassemble it again and thoroughly check one by one. It turnout that the power cable was not properly connected preventing the computer from booting.

This lab session is quite thought-provoking but I really love it! This lab have really give me lots of benefit as I get to hands on experience thus making it easy for me to remember the step.
